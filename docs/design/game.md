## game ideas

- wolfenstein clone where you play as Latvia fighting the USSR 
- possibly more 'expansion packs' with different stories with different enemy types
- 

# Player in the world stuff
- the game will have 'gravity', collision, 'move and slide'
- the game will have moving platforms, as described earlier. These will move from one vector3 to another vector3 with a speed and a delay. The delay will be how long it stays there
- there will be interactive stuff. For intsance, doors that open, doors that open when a button is pressed, doors that open when keys are used
- there will be health pickups, weapon pickups, ammo, etc.
- maybe add in transition screens where we can add graphics

# Weapons
- wep_00: knife
- wep_01: pistol (nagant revolver)
- wep_02: heavy pistol (c96)
- wep_03: rifle (mosin nagant)
- wep_04: smg (ppsh41)
- wep_05: mg (dp27)

# Enemies 

enemies should be a single class with a lot of variables. but the enemy class will have variations that inherit the data and do stuff.

# How enemies do stuff
they will hav

# Enemy Object
